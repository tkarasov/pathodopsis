# pathodopsis
Metagenomic and 16S analysis of Eurasian collections in 2018

## 16S and ITS analysis
16S and ITS were analysed using DADA2
A modified version of the pipeline and scripts detailed here: https://github.com/LangilleLab/microbiome_helper/wiki/DADA2-16S-Chemerin-Tutorial were used for the analysis.

### Amplicon analysis with DADA2

We created a conda environment titled pathodopsis
```console
conda activate pathodopsis
```
